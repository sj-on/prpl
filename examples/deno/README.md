# PRPL Deno Example

Example site using [Deno](https://deno.land) for the build step.

This is possible via the [experimental Node.js compatibility mode](https://deno.land/manual@v1.17.1/npm_nodejs/compatibility_mode) provided in Deno since v1.15.

Other than that, it's the same as the [basic example](../basic/README.md).
