# PRPL

PPRL is a **modular** static site generator built for **longevity**. It lets you interpolate HTML without the kitchen sink.

---

Start developing in one command:

```shell
npx -y create-prpl@latest
```

or head over to [getting started](getting-started).

### Why use PRPL?

#### 🚰 No kitchen sink

Chances are you have tried other static site generators and thought they were overkill. PPRL can be used just to interpolate your content into HTML.

#### 🎛 No bundlers, configuration or underlying frameworks

The worst kind of technical debt comes from tooling and dependency trees. PRPL stays small and gets out of your way.

#### ⚡️ Very, very fast
Using this project's namesake pattern, PRPL uses modern client-side prefetching and routing systems to help your site 
achieve max speed.
