# create-prpl

Utility used for initializing PRPL projects via `npx -y create-prpl@latest`.

It does three things:

1. Copies the [basic PRPL example](../../examples/basic/REAMDME.md) to your file system
2. Downloads one dependency (`@prpl/core`) and one dev dependency (`@prpl/server`)
3. Runs the local dev server
