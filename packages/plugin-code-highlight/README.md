# @prpl/plugin-code-highlight

A plugin for [PRPL](https://github.com/tyhopp/prpl) that highlights code blocks with [Prism](https://prismjs.com).

This plugin **does not include any CSS**. It processes code blocks given the specified syntax (e.g., JavaScript, 
Python) and outputs DOM structures in place that are possible to style with CSS.

Visit the [Prism](https://prismjs.com/download.html) website to download boilerplate CSS and adjust them as needed 
for your site.
